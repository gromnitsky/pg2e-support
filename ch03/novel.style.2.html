      "C'est beaucoup que le jugement des hommes sur les actions
      humaines; tôt ou tard il devient efficace."<br/>
      —GUIZOT.

    <p>
      Sir James Chettam could not look with any satisfaction on
      Mr. Brooke's new courses; but it was easier to object than to
      hinder. Sir James accounted for his having come in alone one day to
      lunch with the Cadwalladers by saying—
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't talk to you as I want, before Celia: it might hurt her.
      Indeed, it would not be right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what you mean—the 'Pioneer' at the Grange!" darted in
      Mrs. Cadwallader, almost before the last word was off her friend's
      tongue. "It is frightful—this taking to buying whistles and blowing
      them in everybody's hearing. Lying in bed all day and playing at
      dominoes, like poor Lord Plessy, would be more private and
      bearable."
